
The syntax for round changed between julia 0.6 and julia 1.0; for
julia 0.7 both syntaxes work. Anyway, if you are using julia with a
version >= 1.0 you need to change the round command in the submission
programme to

round(number,digits=rounding)

I don't think it might be even more confusing to make two versions of
the submission programme to deal with this, but sorry for any
confusion!
